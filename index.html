    <p style="text-indent: -30px; margin-left: 30px;line-height: 1 ">Newton, Fred. "The New Student." <i>About Campus</i> 5.5 (2000): 1-32. <i>Wiley Online Library. </i>Web.
    </p>
    <hr> 
    <p>In his publication to <i>About Campus</i>, Dr. Fred B. Newton targets educators with a call to action to better understand a new “breed” of students on campus, namely the millennial generation. Newton structures his article by identifying the characteristics of the millennial student, offering explanation for the dynamics of these student changes, and calling for educational methods to influence the millennial student.  </p>
    
    <p> In a careful analysis of the new generation of students, Newton identifies that “students entering college have had greater exposure and more experimentation with ‘grown-up’ activity than any previous generation.” As students are experimenting with sex, drugs, money spending, or even lifestyle options, the onset of puberty has grown closer to ten years old, as opposed to the old norm of thirteen. Newton’s conjecture is supported by personal accounts in which students felt like they had “more time to experiment and act out in middle and high school well before arriving at college.” Additionally, Newton labels Millennials as the “home alone” generation – the consequence of parents who compensate for the lack of emotional support with indulgence.  </p> 
    
    <p>On the subject of Millennial characteristics, Newton briefly deliberates into gender differences related to stress and anxiety. Referencing a 1999 study of UCLA freshmen, he found that women were typically more stressed than men: </p>
    
    <p class="quote">“I want it all, the career now [meaning upon graduation], the family [in five to ten years], the nice home with a comfortable lifestyle, and the enjoyment of travel and leisure activity." 
    </p>

    <p>Overall, however, all students, male and female, commanded very competitive salaries. <p> 
      <p class="quote">“Students are ambitious in their career aspirations yet frequently have unrealistic expectations about what it takes to achieve these goals.” </p> 
        <span class="conversation">[His discussion of ambitious students and the failure to properly plan for those goals, which may well connect to the ideas related to the obsessive culture of “getting in.” @Deresiewicz, @Stabiner]</span>
    <p> Newton pointed out that the process of matching students and good jobs would soon go deeper than “getting in the door” of employment.  </p>

    <p> 
    In tackling the influence that faculty could have on students, Newton urges consciousness about differing attitudes and beliefs of Millennial students towards education. He suggests that educators understand how they model what is important and valued as higher learning to students. </p> 
    <p class="quote">“We must not lose sight of the value that make the academy a place where students develop fully as citizens and not as robots following a prescribed set of behaviors with a bottom-line economic value.” </p>

"Rethinking the Structural Architecture of the College Classroom." <i>From Entitlement to Engagement : Affirming Millennial Students' Egos in the Higher Education Classroom New Directions for Teaching and Learning.</i> Eds. Dave S. Knowlton and Kevin Jack Hagopian. 135 Vol. Somerset, NJ, USA: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013. 7-18. <i>ProQuest ebrary. </i>Web. 12 Feb 2015.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>In this section titled “Rethinking the Structural Architecture of the College Classroom,” Kevin Hagopian outlines practical teaching and learning methods that faculty can use to “reevaluate pedagogical practices and rethink the norms of a college classroom for the twenty-first century.”</p>
    <p>He begins by discussing the idea of “entitlement” as attributing to negative student behavior in the classroom. Hagopian examines student disrespect in the context of American society at large: </p>
    <p class ="quote">“Because Millennial students sometimes enter the classroom expecting it to be a repetition of the habits of high school, they may feel that they already understand the psychological architecture of the classroom.” </p>
    <p> He discusses that as a result of this student attitude, “it is the world immediately beyond the classroom whose prospect is truly exciting.”<span class="conversation"> [This world, as indicated by @Make School and @Kamanetz, is already beginning to become incorporated into student curriculums.]</span></p>
    <p> Hagopian dissects the Millennial perspective on the college experience, revealing it to be a “dynamic space” for students to discover themselves by opposing traditions of previous generations. The classroom is recognized as full of rigid demarcation; students seek quantitative approval from faculty, effectively avoiding course-based “ego engagement” with faculty, content, and each other. </p>
    <p>In examining methods for leveraging student ego to improve the learning process, Hagopian discusses regulatory thinking fostered by the typical classroom. Hagopian references the common sentiments of students who represent the “separate agendas of professor and student.” As commonly heard by students in conversation: </p>
    <p class="quote">“I wish she’d just tell us what she wants!” </p>
    <p>In order to address this problem, he suggests that faculty be comfortable with addressing the question, “Why do we need to know this?” This draws directly from the need of student egos to “create the intersection between self and subject.” <span class="conversation">[Many of Hagopian’s ideas related to communication methods and true relationships with students, are related to the framework structured by @Newton.]</span></p>
    <p>Ultimately, Hagopian urges other educators to aim for relevance in material as opposed to intellectual ease as a method to truly engage a generation of ego-driven students.</p>

    <h2> What Are You Going to Do With That? (Deresiewicz)</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: -30px; margin-left: 30px;line-height: 2 ">Deresiewicz, William. "What are You Going to do with that?" <i>The Chronicle</i> 2010. <i>chronicle.com. </i>Web. 12 Feb 2015 &lt;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/What-Are-You-Going-to-Do-With/124651/" target="_blank">http://chronicle.com/article/What-Are-You-Going-to-Do-With/124651/</a>&gt;.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>In an adapted essay from a speech he gave to Stanford students, Deresiewicz directly asks students to question their educational philosophies. He initiates his argument to target an audience of students who, for a long time, have adhered to a systemic framework of “getting very good at a certain set of skills.” However, with specialization comes a deficit: </p> 
    <p class="quote">“What’s wrong is what the system leaves out: which is to say, everything else.”</p>
    <p>A strong focus on his piece is commentary about tunnel vision necessary for acquiring skills to “get in:” </p>
    <p class="quote">“The problem with specialization is that it narrows your attention to the point where all you know about and all you want to know about, and indeed, all you can know about, is your specialty.” </p>
    <p>With his target audience in mind, Deresiewicz deftly frames the problem of great students carrying “an ever-narrowing funnel of specialization:” </p>
    <p class="quote">“As you get deeper and deeper into the funnel, into the tunnel, it becomes increasingly difficult to remember who you once were.”  </p>
    <p>Following strong introductions of a potential problem, he draws his audience to the core of the problem. “It’s easy,” Deresiewicz describes: going with the flow, and making choices just like everyone else. In overcoming the trap of “funneled” choices, he proposes, “true self-esteem means not caring whether you get an A in the first place.” Deresiewicz follows up by describing a solution of “moral imagination” through which students have the capacity to imagine new ways to live. <span class="conversation">[The idea of “moral imagination” in the classroom, along with a “post emotional generation” leading students to make “easy” decisions offers a valid fundamental mindset to approach the current problems of higher education as identified in @Hagopian]</span></p>
    <p>As a final call to action, Deresiewicz urges his audience, students belonging to a “post emotional” generation, to challenge the turbulent and powerful feelings in themselves.  <span class="conversation">[In his targeted piece, Deresiewicz discusses the consequences of a current Millennial mindset. This serves as validation for the framework structured by @Newton.]</span>

    <p>In this case study of a new schooling system seeking to change the way students engage with their education, Anya Kamanetz describes the Minerva school, which calls itself “the first elite American university to open in 100 years.” With this bold statement, the founders of Minerva seek to foster a </p>
    <p class="quote">“global long tail of high achievers who are good enough for the Ivy League but lack the money or luck of the anointed few who are admitted.” </p>
    <p>This article summarizes Minerva’s efforts to “rethink everything:” bring together the world’s best curriculum with the best students, professors, and the lowest possible price. At the core of this program is a rented space in San Francisco where all students live together. Throughout the course of four years, they move between the world’s great capitals while studying an interdisciplinary core curriculum in liberal arts and sciences. The focus of education is on critical thinking and communication, delivered in real-time seminar style discussions with professors. <span class="conversation">[Framed as a promising experiment for higher education, Kamanetz identifies the power of alternate education settings.

    <p>The mission of Make School is to essentially improve computer science education and speaking passion by building real products. With strong credibility as a startup with support and funding from YCombinator’s prestigious incubator, Andreessen Horowitz, Tim Draper, and Alex Ohanion, this growing startup pushes students in the doors of the technology industry by giving them exactly the skills they need to join the workforce. <span class="conversation">[In contrast to @Deresiewicz idea of the importance of liberal arts education, Make School encourages students to skip the “miscellaneous” college education and focus only on the necessary vocational skills that allow them to build products right away.]</span></p>

    <p>Matthew Abrams, co-founder of experimental learning laboratory Mycelium, highlights education models that highlight strategies for “cultivating 21st century skills” in his article “New Models for Higher Education.” <span class="conversation">[What does Abrams mean by 21st century skills?

He brings up an interesting advantage to new models of education: </p>
    <p class="quote">“They have a mandate to produce real, tangible value, because if they don’t, they disappear.”</p>
    <span class="conversation">[Abrams introduces the idea of new models of education disappearing if they fail… @Minerva @Make School. Along the same vein, why can’t this method of thinking be applied to in-doctrinated education models?]</span>
    <p>Abrams proposes “measuring what counts” through Gamification, as achieved by social enterprises like Producia, in which students gain “experience” through non-tranditional metrics to unlock perks within the community. He also emphasizes the power of human relationships: </p>
    <p class="quote">“The core of these new programs is not technology, but humans.”</p> 
    <span class="conversation">[Is it possible to get too ingrained in technology, like at @Minerva?]</span>
    <p>Finally, Abrams suggests the model of multi-dimensional learning in which students embrace a belief that people “can surface a wellspring of insight and innovation by diving into their personal challenges.” </p>
    <p>As a whole, the article suggests the possibility of new education programs to go beyond “what is” and focus on “what’s possible.” </p>

    <span class="conversation">[Glorification in the startup/tech industry? New form of “education” – simply avoiding it an going into the real world. @Abrams]</span>
    <p>Alex William’s New York Times article, “Saying No to College,” offers a rationale for avoiding conventional higher education models. He initially highlights the experiences of Mr. Goering, dropout from University of Kansas. Goering seeks to “create tools that make the lives of others better.” [Perhaps a naïve, millennial mindset? @The New Student] Overall, Williams identifies a changing perception of dropping out from personal failure to a sensible option. </p>
    <p>Williams glorifies the idea of dropping out of college by referencing various “superstars” for which “dropping out basically had no effect, positive or negative, on the work and company and values [they] would create.” </p>
    <p class="quote">“Risky? Perhaps. But it worked for the founders of Twitter, Tumblr, and a little company known as Apple.”  </p>
    <p>As pointed out by Mick Hagen, Princeton dropout and founder of Undrip, “Here in Silicon Valley, it’s almost a badge of honor.” In fact, dropouts were viewed as freethinkers, risk-takers, and “untainted by groupthink.” Williams then alludes to popular television like “The Mindy Project,” in which a character questions rather ironically: </p>
    <p class="quote">“Why should I load up on debt just to binge drink for four years when I could just create an app that nets me all the money I’ll ever need?” </p>
    <p>He follows up the glorification of dropping out by introducing the disadvantage of student debt: </p>
    <p class="quote">“Rich people can still afford college, but poor people are still borrowing this money and sacrificing their future for a lifetime of debt.” </p> 
    <p>With various references to Uncollege, a program that advocates informational “hacakdemic” camps, Williams suggests self-directed learning which includes travel, volunteer work, and organizing collaborative learning groups with friends. Uncollege encouraged: </p>
    <p class="quote">“Students who want to avoid $200,000 in student-loan debt might consider enrolling in a technology boot camp, where you can learn to write code in 8 to 10 weeks for about $10,000.” </p>

    <p>In response to Deresiewicz’s views about the Ivy League education, JD Chapman highlights his own experiences as an academic director to pushback on those held by Deresiewicz. He mentions his students who attend an independent high school with a variety of family backgrounds, few of who share the prejudices Deresiewicz assumes. </p>
    <p class="quote">“I don’t know many people who think it will be th end of the world if their child doesn’t attend an Ivy.” </p>
    <p>While Deresiewicz concludes that the Ivies don’t encourage “curiosity” among students, Chapman argues that admissions officers want exactly the types of students Deresiewicz implies that they don’t. As Deresiewicz suggests that students at elite institutions are emotionally dislocated, Chapman points out that the study referenced for this fact failed to disaggregate data by selectivity. </p>
    <p>Overall, Chapman makes an effort to counter Deresiewicz’s arguments, concluding that the Ivy League could be potentially valuable, especially for someone whose family had no access to elite careers like teaching at Yale and writing for the New Republic. <span class="conversation">[A direct attack on @Deresiewicz.]</span> </p>
