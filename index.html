    <p style="text-indent: -30px; margin-left: 30px;line-height: 1 ">Newton, Fred. "The New Student." <i>About Campus</i> 5.5 (2000): 1-32. <i>Wiley Online Library. </i>Web.
    </p>
    <hr> 
    <p>In his publication to <i>About Campus</i>, Dr. Fred B. Newton targets educators with a call to action to better understand a new “breed” of students on campus, namely the millennial generation. Newton structures his article by identifying the characteristics of the millennial student, offering explanation for the dynamics of these student changes, and calling for educational methods to influence the millennial student.  </p>
    
    <p> In a careful analysis of the new generation of students, Newton identifies that “students entering college have had greater exposure and more experimentation with ‘grown-up’ activity than any previous generation.” As students are experimenting with sex, drugs, money spending, or even lifestyle options, the onset of puberty has grown closer to ten years old, as opposed to the old norm of thirteen. Newton’s conjecture is supported by personal accounts in which students felt like they had “more time to experiment and act out in middle and high school well before arriving at college.” Additionally, Newton labels Millennials as the “home alone” generation – the consequence of parents who compensate for the lack of emotional support with indulgence.  </p> 
    
    <p>On the subject of Millennial characteristics, Newton briefly deliberates into gender differences related to stress and anxiety. Referencing a 1999 study of UCLA freshmen, he found that women were typically more stressed than men: </p>
    
    <p class="quote">“I want it all, the career now [meaning upon graduation], the family [in five to ten years], the nice home with a comfortable lifestyle, and the enjoyment of travel and leisure activity." 
    </p>

    <p>Overall, however, all students, male and female, commanded very competitive salaries. <p> 
      <p class="quote">“Students are ambitious in their career aspirations yet frequently have unrealistic expectations about what it takes to achieve these goals.” </p> 
        <span class="conversation">[His discussion of ambitious students and the failure to properly plan for those goals, which may well connect to the ideas related to the obsessive culture of “getting in.”]</span>
    <p> Newton pointed out that the process of matching students and good jobs would soon go deeper than “getting in the door” of employment.  </p>

    <p> 
    In tackling the influence that faculty could have on students, Newton urges consciousness about differing attitudes and beliefs of Millennial students towards education. He suggests that educators understand how they model what is important and valued as higher learning to students. </p> 
    <p class="quote">“We must not lose sight of the value that make the academy a place where students develop fully as citizens and not as robots following a prescribed set of behaviors with a bottom-line economic value.” </p>

    <h2> Rethinking the Structural Architecture of the College Classroom (Hagopian)</h2>

"Rethinking the Structural Architecture of the College Classroom." <i>From Entitlement to Engagement : Affirming Millennial Students' Egos in the Higher Education Classroom New Directions for Teaching and Learning.</i> Eds. Dave S. Knowlton and Kevin Jack Hagopian. 135 Vol. Somerset, NJ, USA: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2013. 7-18. <i>ProQuest ebrary. </i>Web. 12 Feb 2015.

    <hr>
    <p>In this section titled “Rethinking the Structural Architecture of the College Classroom,” Kevin Hagopian outlines practical teaching and learning methods that faculty can use to “reevaluate pedagogical practices and rethink the norms of a college classroom for the twenty-first century.”</p>
    <p>He begins by discussing the idea of “entitlement” as attributing to negative student behavior in the classroom. Hagopian examines student disrespect in the context of American society at large: </p>
    <p class ="quote">“Because Millennial students sometimes enter the classroom expecting it to be a repetition of the habits of high school, they may feel that they already understand the psychological architecture of the classroom.” </p>
    <p> He discusses that as a result of this student attitude, “it is the world immediately beyond the classroom whose prospect is truly exciting.”<span class="conversation"> [This world, as indicated by @Make School and @Minerva, is already beginning to become incorporated into student curriculums.]</span></p>
    <p> Hagopian dissects the Millennial perspective on the college experience, revealing it to be a “dynamic space” for students to discover themselves by opposing traditions of previous generations. The classroom is recognized as full of rigid demarcation; students seek quantitative approval from faculty, effectively avoiding course-based “ego engagement” with faculty, content, and each other. </p>
    <p>In examining methods for leveraging student ego to improve the learning process, Hagopian discusses regulatory thinking fostered by the typical classroom. Hagopian references the common sentiments of students who represent the “separate agendas of professor and student.” As commonly heard by students in conversation: </p>
    <p class="quote">“I wish she’d just tell us what she wants!” </p>
    <p>In order to address this problem, he suggests that faculty be comfortable with addressing the question, “Why do we need to know this?” This draws directly from the need of student egos to “create the intersection between self and subject.” <span class="conversation">[Many of Hagopian’s ideas related to communication methods and true relationships with students, are related to the framework structured by @The New Student.]</span></p>
    <p>Ultimately, Hagopian urges other educators to aim for relevance in material as opposed to intellectual ease as a method to truly engage a generation of ego-driven students.</p>

    <h2> What Are You Going to Do With That? (Deresiewicz)</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: -30px; margin-left: 30px;line-height: 2 ">Deresiewicz, William. "What are You Going to do with that?" <i>The Chronicle</i> 2010. <i>chronicle.com. </i>Web. 12 Feb 2015 &lt;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/What-Are-You-Going-to-Do-With/124651/" target="_blank">http://chronicle.com/article/What-Are-You-Going-to-Do-With/124651/</a>&gt;.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>In an adapted essay from a speech he gave to Stanford students, Deresiewicz directly asks students to question their educational philosophies. He initiates his argument to target an audience of students who, for a long time, have adhered to a systemic framework of “getting very good at a certain set of skills.” However, with specialization comes a deficit: </p> 
    <p class="quote">“What’s wrong is what the system leaves out: which is to say, everything else.”</p>
    <p>A strong focus on his piece is commentary about tunnel vision necessary for acquiring skills to “get in:” </p>
    <p class="quote">“The problem with specialization is that it narrows your attention to the point where all you know about and all you want to know about, and indeed, all you can know about, is your specialty.” </p>
    <p>With his target audience in mind, Deresiewicz deftly frames the problem of great students carrying “an ever-narrowing funnel of specialization:” </p>
    <p class="quote">“As you get deeper and deeper into the funnel, into the tunnel, it becomes increasingly difficult to remember who you once were.”  </p>
    <p>Following strong introductions of a potential problem, he draws his audience to the core of the problem. “It’s easy,” Deresiewicz describes: going with the flow, and making choices just like everyone else. In overcoming the trap of “funneled” choices, he proposes, “true self-esteem means not caring whether you get an A in the first place.” Deresiewicz follows up by describing a solution of “moral imagination” through which students have the capacity to imagine new ways to live. <span class="conversation">[The idea of “moral imagination” in the classroom, along with a “post emotional generation” leading students to make “easy” decisions offers a valid fundamental mindset to approach the current problems of higher education as identified in @From Entitlement to Engagement]</span></p>
    <p>As a final call to action, Deresiewicz urges his audience, students belonging to a “post emotional” generation, to challenge the turbulent and powerful feelings in themselves.  <span class="conversation">[In his targeted piece, Deresiewicz discusses the consequences of a current Millennial mindset. This serves as validation for the framework structured by @The New Student.]</span>
